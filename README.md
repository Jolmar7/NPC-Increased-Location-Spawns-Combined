# NPC-Increased-Location-Spawns-Combined
Adds a large number of NPC spawns to the world of CDDA, making the world a far more populated and violent place. Inspired by Escape from Tarkov.

This mod adds in NPCs that spawn via Bright Night's map event system, allowing NPCs to spawn into the world in large numbers similar to monstergroups. Unfortunately, NPC combat leaves a lot to be desired so the gameplay loop with such a large amount of NPCs could cause difficulty and progression issues

This mod increases the spawns for a variety of factions, some of which are unique to this mod:
-Bandits
-Scavs
-Friendly Wanderers
-National Guard Remnants
-UN Peacekeepers
-USEC Mercenaries
-BEAR Mercenaries

This mod also adds in a small number of new locations that can house NPCs.
